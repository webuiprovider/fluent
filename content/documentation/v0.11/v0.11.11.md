###### KNOWLEDGE BASE

### Release Notes v0.11.11

[Fluent Bit](https://fluentbit.io/) is a Fast and Lightweight Data Forwarder for Linux, BSD and OSX. We are proud to announce the availability of **Fluent Bit v0.11.11.**

#### Changes

This is a bug fix release over 0.11 series that includes the following changes:

**Core**

* Pack: json-encoding: detect and skip already escaped characters.


**Plugins**

* [Kubernetes (filter)](https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.11/filter/kubernetes.html): new **merge_json_key** option. If merged json is to be included, this new option acts as a parent key for the new structured fields.
* [Kubernetes (filter)](https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.11/filter/kubernetes.html): new **dummy_meta** option, when set the filter do not try to gather metadata from the API server, instead it just append a random record as meta. Useful testing and development.
* [Tail (input)](https://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.11/input/tail.html): workaround for rotated files monitored originally using relative paths instead of absolute paths.
